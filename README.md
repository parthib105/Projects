# 🚀 Projects

Welcome to my **Projects** repository — a growing collection of personal, academic, and exploratory software projects. This monorepo serves as a central hub for all my work in Python, C++, automation, machine learning, and more.

Each project is self-contained, well-documented, and modular — built with learning, utility, and open sharing in mind.
